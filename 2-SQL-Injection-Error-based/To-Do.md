# ✅ TO-DO – 2: SQL Injection (Error-Based)

This checklist outlines a methodical approach to identifying, exploiting, and analyzing error-based SQL injection (SQLi) vectors in OWASP Juice Shop. This includes payload testing, response validation, and recon based on backend SQL error disclosures. The goal is to expose insecure query handling that reflects raw SQL/DBMS errors back to the client.

## 📌 Attack Workflow Checklist

| Task                                                                | Status |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 🛠️ Launch Juice Shop using Docker                                  | ☐      |
| 🧪 Identify injectable input fields (login, search, feedback, etc.) | ☐      |
| 🎯 Intercept request using Burp Suite or browser DevTools           | ☐      |
| 💉 Inject faulty SQL payloads into input vector                     | ☐      |
| 🔍 Observe for verbose SQL errors in server response                | ☐      |
| 📄 Log all HTTP request/response headers                            | ☐      |
| 🧾 Capture full stack trace / SQL error string                      | ☐      |
| 🧠 Analyze DBMS type and inference opportunity                      | ☐      |
| 📸 Take screenshots of injection points and errors                  | ☐      |
| 📁 Archive artifacts (Burp logs, curl output, payloads used)        | ☐      |

## 🧬 Payloads for Error-Based SQLi

### 🔸 Classic Single Quote Injection
```json
"email": "'",
"password": "anything"
````

> 📍 Expected: `SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token`

---

### 🔸 Arithmetic Exception

```json
"email": "'||(1/0)||'",
"password": "test"
```

> 📍 Expected: division by zero, arithmetic error message from DB

---

### 🔸 Invalid Column/Table Name Reference

```json
"email": "'||(SELECT * FROM invalid_table)||'",
"password": "dummy"
```

> 📍 Expected: `no such table: invalid_table`

---

## 🧪 Terminal-Based Testing (curl)

### 🔍 Using curl for POST-based SQLi payload

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/rest/user/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"\'", "password":"test"}' -v
```

### 📍 Expected Output:

* HTTP `500 Internal Server Error` or `400 Bad Request`
* JSON Error:

```json
{
  "error": "SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: \"'\""
}
```

* Stack trace in verbose mode (depending on backend settings)

## 📂 Suggested Artifacts

| Artifact File            | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `injection_payloads.sql` | Full list of faulty SQLi test cases           |
| `burp_requests_sqli.txt` | Raw intercepted payloads + responses          |
| `curl_responses.log`     | Terminal output of all crafted requests       |
| `error_messages.md`      | Annotated DB errors with contextual analysis  |
| `screenshots/`           | Visual capture of reflected DB error messages |

## 🧠 What to Look For

| Indicator                      | Inference/Recon                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `SQLITE_ERROR`                 | SQLite backend in use                        |
| `unrecognized token`, `syntax` | Input is parsed and evaluated as SQL         |
| `no such column/table`         | Confirms real-time execution of injected SQL |
| Server crash or 500 error      | Potential for DoS or unhandled exceptions    |

## 🧭 Mapping to Offensive Security Domains

| Domain               | Value Gained                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web App Pentesting   | SQLi recon, injection confirmation          |
| Red Teaming          | Enumeration, pivot for chained exploits     |
| Exploit Development  | Behavior-based fingerprinting of DB backend |
| Secure Coding Review | Detection of lack of sanitization/logging   |

---

## 🛡️ Suggested Post-Test Analysis

* [ ] Determine if backend uses ORM (e.g., Sequelize) vs raw SQL
* [ ] Identify if payloads leak stack trace + file path
* [ ] Check if input encoding (URL, Base64) bypasses frontend filter
* [ ] Validate if time-based or blind SQLi vectors exist post-recon

🧠 **Pro Tip:** Store your findings in a structured Markdown PoC report for use in later stages of chained attacks (e.g., privilege escalation via data extraction).
