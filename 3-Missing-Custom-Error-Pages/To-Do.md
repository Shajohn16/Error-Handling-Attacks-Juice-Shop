# ✅ TO-DO – 3: Missing Custom Error Pages

This checklist outlines a precise workflow for triggering and analyzing default error pages in Juice Shop. The goal is to provoke server-generated 404/500 responses that leak underlying implementation details — a critical recon asset during red teaming and vulnerability assessments.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Force unhandled application routes or unexpected server errors to reveal default error pages. Analyze their structure, headers, and verbose content for stack traces, server fingerprints, or unintended disclosures.

## 📋 Attack Workflow Checklist

| Task                                                               | Status |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 🔃 Launch Juice Shop using Docker                                  | ☐      |
| 🌐 Open browser or use curl to target invalid routes               | ☐      |
| 💉 Craft malformed or undefined URLs (`/invalid_route`)            | ☐      |
| 📸 Observe error message content via curl and browser              | ☐      |
| 📄 Capture HTTP response headers (`X-Powered-By`, content-type)    | ☐      |
| 🧠 Identify technology leaks (framework, middleware)               | ☐      |
| 📝 Document stack trace, route leakage, or HTML error templates    | ☐      |
| 📁 Save curl output, error dumps, DevTools response previews       | ☐      |
| 🧪 Optionally run directory brute-force tools for route discovery  | ☐      |

## 💣 Payload Strategy: Invalid Routes

Test the following in browser, Burp, or curl:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3000/super-secret-admin
curl -i http://localhost:3000/../../etc/passwd
curl -i http://localhost:3000/404thisshouldnotexist
````

Observe the response body, headers, and error patterns.

---

## 📄 Example curl Test

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/invalid_route -v
```

📍 Expected Output:

* `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` or `500 Internal Server Error`
* Header:

  * `X-Powered-By: Express`
* Body:

  * Text like `Cannot GET /invalid_route`
  * Stack trace (if uncaught exception triggered)

## 🧾 Data to Collect

| Artifact                  | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `curl_response.log`       | Raw HTTP output from invalid endpoint       |
| `burp_response.txt`       | Intercepted full HTTP 404/500 response      |
| `express_headers.md`      | All captured headers and their significance |
| `screenshots/`            | Browser/DevTools captures of error pages    |
| `fingerprinting_notes.md` | Server type, framework leak observations    |

---

## 🔍 Follow-Up Enumeration (Optional)

Use tools like FFUF or Dirbuster:

```bash
ffuf -u http://localhost:3000/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

📍 Identify additional routes that result in verbose errors or stack traces.

## 🧠 Security Research Value

| Vector                    | Value Gained                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Default Error Page Leak   | Technology fingerprinting (e.g., Express) |
| Stack Trace Disclosure    | Code structure, vulnerable file names     |
| Unhandled Route Discovery | Leads to attack surface expansion         |

---

## 🛠️ Hardening Checks

| Header                 | What to Inspect                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `X-Powered-By`         | Should be removed in production          |
| Status Codes (404/500) | Should return generic user-facing errors |
| CSP Headers            | Should exist to prevent code injection   |

📂 Store all findings, responses, and screenshots for reporting or pivoting into further enumeration/exploitation.
